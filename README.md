# Genomic Comparision Practical

In 2011, a very infectious strain of *E. coli* spread through Germany. Nearly 4000 people were affected and over 50 people died as a result. In such cases, the focus is often on identifying potential drug targets among the genes of the new strain. In this practical, we carry out a genome annotation of this strain and examine the conservation of antibiotic-resistant genes in this and other strains of *E. coli*.
